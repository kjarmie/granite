## Granite

A self-hosted backup & sync solution for Obsidian.
</div>

# Quick start

With Granite, you can sync multiple Obsidian Vaults between devices in real time, with end-to-end encryption, with a simple
API key validation. Granite is aimed at users or groups that require data privacy and don't want their data hosted by a 
third party.

The web service provides real time and secure replication of notes, configuration, and plugins from the Obsidian app via 
the Granite plugin.
